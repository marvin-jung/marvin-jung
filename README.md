Hi there! My name is Marvin, and I'm a recent MBA and Business Analytics graduate from HULT International Business School.<br> I'm excited to use my skills and knowledge to make a difference as a data scientist, and I'm open to collaborating with organizations that are working on meaningful projects. In addition to my business background, I'm also learning about machine learning and cloud AI to further enhance my data science skillset. If you have a project that could benefit from my expertise, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me through [iCloud](mailto:jisung.jung@me.com), [Gmail](mailto:withsee@gmail.com), [Outlook](mailto:jjung2019@student.hult.edu), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/annagale), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrvn-jung) .
